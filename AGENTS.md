# Project notes for agents

Deliberate decisions in this repo - do NOT silently revert them:

- `homebrew.onActivation.cleanup = "none"` in `configuration.nix` is intentional: applying never removes an installed item. Undeclared Homebrew items are reported, not deleted. Do not tighten it back to `uninstall` or `zap`, which once threatened to delete in-use tools and app data.
- Never commit `.no-mistakes/` validation evidence to this public repo. `.no-mistakes/` is gitignored; if a validation pipeline stages evidence into a branch, drop it before merging.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
